# Setup Windows
Here we describe the setup for Windows.

## Installing MySpeed

1. Download MySpeed  
   Download the latest version of MySpeed from the [releases page](https://github.com/gnmyt/myspeed/releases/latest). Download the file `myspeed-windows-x64.exe`.

2. Place the file  
   Move the downloaded file to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\MySpeed`). Rename it to `myspeed.exe` for convenience.

3. Test your installation  
   Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in the folder where you placed the file (Shift + Right-click > "Open PowerShell window here").  
   Run the executable:
   ```powershell
   .\myspeed.exe
   ```

   If everything runs successfully, you did everything right! Congratulations. :)   
   MySpeed is now available on port 5216. Open http://localhost:5216 in your browser.

## Automatic startup using the autostart folder in Windows

1. Open the autostart folder in windows  
   Press both keys (`Windows` + `R`) simultaneously on your keyboard until a Run dialog appears. Then type `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` and press `Enter`.

2. Create a shortcut  
   Right-click in the folder and select `New` > `Shortcut`. Browse to your `myspeed.exe` file and create the shortcut.

3. If everything worked, MySpeed should now start automatically when the system is started.
